# Food Effects

## ðŸ“– About

Food Effects aims to re-balance Minecraft's various food items by giving each of them unique Effects upon consumption. 

It was designed with the aim of being highly configurable, and so you can change the Effect any food item gives you, 
the duration of that effect, and the amplifier/level of the effect too, all through the in-game config!
